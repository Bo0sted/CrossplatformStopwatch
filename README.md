# Welcome to my Cross Platform Timer
Written in pure C++ with the help of the lovely Qt framework. Multi-threaded to ensure the stopwatch is never delayed and the UI is responsive and easy to use. Settings are always and loaded from an INI file within your Documents folder. 

# Caveats as of 1.0 Beta
- Numpad keys are not assignable. This is due to a [known limitation](https://github.com/Skycoder42/QHotkey?tab=readme-ov-file#known-limitations) with the hotkey library I chose for this project.
- Hotkeys will work from anywhere on your system, but **only** the stopwatch will receieve those specific keys. If your hotkeys are 1 and 2 and you try to type the number 1 or 2 in Discord for example, they wont work. Only the stopwatch will receieve those keys. This means you should take your keys into careful consideration.
- Turning the background on/off is broken and requires a program restart to see the effect changed

[Although these caveats exist in this version of my stopwatch, they do not exist in the **Windows only** version I made. If you're using Windows, check out [another version](https://github.com/Bo0sted/SimpleUsefulTimer) of this stopwatch thats written natively for Windows.

As of right now I do not intend to fix any of these caveats because I do not deem them essential enough to warrant all the work required to fixing them.
