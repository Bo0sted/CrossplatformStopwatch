# Welcome to Crossplatform Stopwatch
- Stopwatch has Start, Stop and Reset state. Press 1 to Start/Stop and 2 to reset. Hotkeys are re-assigable in settings.
- System clock monitor available. Enable in settings. 
- Settings are automatically saved and loaded on startup
- Lots of customization options
- Multi-threaded design to ensure the time is never delayed and user interface is responsive and fluid.
- Stopwatch window always on top of other windows by default
- Hotkeys are always global. This means the hotkeys will work anywhere on your system even if the stopwatch is not in focus.
- Written in pure C++ using the lovely Qt framework to make this app cross platform.
